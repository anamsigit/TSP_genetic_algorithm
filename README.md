The genetic algorithm is a heuristic based search algorithm
on the mechanisms of natural selection and natural genetics. The basic concept
 inspired the emergence of the genetic algorithm is the theory of natural evolution
proposed by Charles Darwin. In this theory it is explained that on
natural evolutionary process, each individual must adapt to
the surrounding environment in order to survive (Kurnia et al., n.d.).

Genetic algorithms may not always achieve the best results, however
often solves the problem quite well. Genetic Algorithm
represents a solution to a problem as a chromosome. There is
Some important aspects in genetic algorithms include function definition
fitness, definition and implementation of genetic representation, definition and
implementation of genetic operations (Suprayogi & Mahmudy, n.d.).
D.E. Golberg in his book uses the Genetic Algorithm method
in solving optimization problems in the industry. GA method then
developed its use in various fields of science, one of them
applied in optimization of distribution network design (Budiastra et al., 2006).
The genetic algorithm in this case is almost similar to the Traveling case
Salesman Problem (TSP).
